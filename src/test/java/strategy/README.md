# Strategy Example

Late on a Friday, your pointy-haired boss asks you to add some methods to AssetUtil.

Add them quickly using copy/paste, then refactor using strategy pattern

1) look at [AssetUtilTest](AssetUtilTest.java)
2) Copy / Paste existing functionality to create a method to total stocks
3) Copy / Paste existing functionality to create a method to total bonds
4) Refactor
