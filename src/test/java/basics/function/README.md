# Functions

Functions take an input and return an output.  The output type can be different from the input type,
so functions are good for data mapping, transforms, and aggregators.

A pure function has no side-effects, such as saving data or passing to other hardware, queues, or systems.

For side-effects, consider using Consumers instead of Functions.
